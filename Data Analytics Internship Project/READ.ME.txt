 📂 Projects

🔹 Google Colab Project (Single Notebook)
All tasks were completed in a single .ipynb file covering:  
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*  
    Handled missing values, duplicates, and standardized data formats.  
🧮 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
    Summary statistics, correlations, and visualization of patterns.  
🖥️ Clustering Analysis (K-Means)*  
    Grouped data points and determined optimal clusters.  
🧮 Predictive Modeling (Classification)*  
    Built models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
